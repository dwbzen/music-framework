// JSON format for Songs (Guitar Fake Book)
// As simple as it can be for fast transcription.
// A Song is comprised of Sections.
// A Section is a named set of Measure that is treated as a functional whole.
// For example, "intro", "verse1", "coda", "bridge" could designate Sections. 
// The name must be unique within the Song.
// Melodies
// A melody has a "name" followed by a "timeSignature" and "key"
// This is followed by an array of "measure" elements.
// Each measure is an array of "melody" which has both a "pitch" and "duration"
// and a pair of booleans if the note is tied to the next note and/or the previous note.
// The timeSignature structure has beatsPerMeasure, beatType, divisions (per beatType)
// beatType = 1 (whole note), 2 (half), 4 (quarter) etc. specifies the note value that has the beat
// divisions is #divisions per beatType
// For example:  "timeSignature" : { "beatsPerMeasure" : 3, "beatType" : 4, "divisions" : 16 }
//   represents 3/4 time signature where a quarter note has 16 divisions - that is, 16th notes.
// The number of divisions must accomodate the shortest duration note needed and also tuplets
//  since note duration is expressed in units of divisions.
// If no time signature is specified, the default 
//	 "timeSignature" : { "beatsPerMeasure" : 4, "beatType" : 4, "divisions" : 96 } is used.
//
// Key specifies an octave neutral pitch, such as C, F, Bb, G#, and Major or Minor.
// For example, "key" : { "pitch" : Bb, "mode" : "minor" }   note that "mode" is not case sensitive.
// If no key is specified, the default "key" : { "pitch" : C, "mode" : "major" } is used.
// Each bar is an array of "note" which has  a "pitch", a "duration" and an optional "type"
// "type", "dot", and "tuplet" are elements of "notation"
// "type" is whole, half quarter, eighth, 16th, 32nd, 64th.
// "dot" : n is the number of dots following the note.
// "tuplet" : <m/n> specifies m notes in the time of n (as 3/2 for a triplet)
//
// "pitch" is a letter A-G followed by an optional accidental: # for sharp, b for flat,
//   and an octave number 0 - 8 (where C/4 = middle C). Octaves start at "C".
//   A pitch of "0" indicates no pitch sounding - i.e. a rest.
//
// "duration" is given terms of basic units (divisions).
// The "duration" is redundant and can be omitted since it is implied by the time signature and note "type"
// For example, in 2/2 time with 192 divisions, "type" : "eighth" has a duration of 48 (half = 192, quarter = 96, eighth = 48)
//
// Given a  "timeSignature" : { "beatsPerMeasure" : 4, "beatType" : 4, "divisions" : 96 }
//  a quarter note has "duration" : 24, an eighth note 12, 16th 6, 32nd 3 and 64th 1.
//  in a triplet of 8th notes, each would have a "duration" : 8 (3 in the time of 2 =  (2 x 12) /3 )
// Specifying notes as triplets is done with the "notations" elements "type" and "tuplet"
// Indicating ties to next/previous note as a notations "tie" : start | stop | continue (in keeping with MusicXML)
//
// Here an example.
// Penny Lane (8 measures). The time signature is cut common time, i.e. 2/2 (instead of 4/4).
// Directions in the music specify Ragtime feeling, so 4 eighth notes are to be played as a quarter + eighth triplet.
// The melody is transcribed as written, i.e. as 8th notes instead of triplets
// NOTE that it is perfectly legal to omit measures if there is a cary-over, thus avoiding same chord appearing consecutively.

// Harmonies (chords)
// JSON for Adding chord changes can be done independently of the associated
// melody (i.e. in a separate file), or can be included in the song with the melody.
// Either way, the beginning sections are the same: "name" through "measures"
//
// In "measure" instead of notes, there is a "harmony" array.
// A chord is specified using the standard chord symbol (see chord_formulas.json for details).
// The root is assumed to be the pitch of the chord symbol.
// For example the root of "Ebm7" is "Eb". The lowest note to play (inversion)
// is specified using a slash chord as in "Ebm7/Gb"
// Duration is not specified, but the beat in the measure where the chord appears is specified.
// If the chord is sounded on a particular beat, the beat number is given : 1, 2 and so on
// If it's sounded off the beat, the beat is given as <beat number>, <division> 
// For example, given "timeSignature" : { "beatsPerMeasure" : 2, "beatType" : 2, "divisions" : 192 }
// which is 2/2 time, a chord sounding on the first beat is "beat" : 1, the second beat "beat" : 2 and so forth.
// No "division" is needed when the chord appears on the beat.
// If the chord change is on the 2nd quarter note say, the beat would be: "beat" : 1, "division" : 48 
// The harmony of the first 8 measures of "Penny Lane" follows. Note that the "0" chord is no chord sounding
// as in the first pickup measure of the song.
// See "Penny Lane.json"
//
// The same thing can be achieved by embedding each "harmony" array in the measure along with the melody.
// See "Fixing A Hole.json"
