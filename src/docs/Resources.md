# Resource Links
The source for all the scales (common and theoretical) is the website [2384 Unique Musical Scales](http://www.harmonics.com/scales/index.html).
Scales in a variety of different formats can be downloaded from that site. I used the [ScaleCoding2011.xls](http://www.lucytune.com/scales/ScaleCodingJan2011.xls) spreadsheet as the primary source for scales.
It also has links to other sites and is a great source of musical theory info on scales, chords and modes.
In particular [LucyTuning](http://www.lucytune.com/new_to_lt/pitch_05.html) is a great resource.

The above sites and many of the scale names reference 12edo which stands for 12 equal divisions of the octave a.k.a. equal temperament or 12et which is the predominant
tuning system used today. For more information on this topic, see the [Equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) Wikipedia article.

The [smartChord](http://www.smartChord.de) app (Copyright 2020 Martin Schule) was the source of additional guitar chords.

My contribution was to create Java/JSON structures and a MongoDB using this raw data, and then using this data to create musical scores from fractal data.
